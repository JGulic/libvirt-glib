libvirt-glib
============

libvirt is a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities
of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes). It is free software
available under the GNU Lesser General Public License. Virtualization on
the Linux Operating System means the ability to run multiple instances of
Operating Systems concurrently on a single hardware system where the basic
resources are driven by a Linux instance. The library aim at providing
long term stable C API initially for the Xen paravirtualization but
should be able to integrate other virtualization mechanisms if needed.

libvirt-glib wraps libvirt to provide a high-level object-oriented API better
suited for glib-based applications, via three libraries:

  - libvirt-glib - GLib main loop integration & misc helper APIs
  - libvirt-gconfig - GObjects for manipulating libvirt XML documents
  - libvirt-gobject - GObjects for managing libvirt objects

libvirt-glib is Free Software and licenced under LGPLv2+.

The latest official releases can be found at:

NB: at this time, libvirt-glib is *NOT* considered API/ABI stable. Future
releases may still include API/ABI incompatible changes.
